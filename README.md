# The-chippering
The chippering project
Game title: The chippering(The last tree) The purpose of the project is to give me a better understanding of what it takes to create the games I love to play. For the game I want to make a fun 2D shooter game that is level based and almost retro with how it plays. An old fashion level based shooter with a funny twist. To make this project ill be using python 3 and PYgame to help me create the fundementals of the game like images, sound affect, motion, backround, etc.
